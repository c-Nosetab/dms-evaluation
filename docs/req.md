# Take-Home Case: Design a Document Management System (DMS)

## Problem Overview

You are tasked with designing a cloud-based Document Management System that includes:

1. **Document Storage:** Secure and scalable document storage on the cloud.
2. **Document Processing:** File transformations like PDF splitting or AI-based OCR based on project-specific rules.
3. A secure Web UI to manage and upload files (think OneDrive/Google Drive).

## Aspects to Cover

- **Development Process**: How would you go about developing the application, and how you would leverage AI tools to be faster while keeping code quality.
- **Choice of Cloud Provider:** Select a cloud provider for the DMS solution.
- **Compute Platform Choice / Scalability / Performance:** Choose a compute platform and discuss scalability and performance considerations.
- **CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure management strategy.
- **Observability & Metrics:** Discuss the monitoring and metrics strategy to track system performance and uptime.
- **Choice of Stack for Frontend, Backend, and other services:** Select the technology stack for the frontend, backend, and any other service you might want to use, explaining pros and cons of choices.
- **Architecture for File Processing:** Define the architecture for processing uploaded files.
- **Authentication Strategy (Web):** Explain the authentication strategy for both the web application and the upload agent.
- **Choice of Database**: Choose a database solution for storing document information and enabling search functionality.

## Considerations:

**Deliverables:**

- **Pre-Interview:**
  - Short < 5 min high-level presentation (ideally a 5-minute Loom video) to be submitted before the interview.
- **Interview:**
  - Present a **15-minute high-level overview** of your solution.
  - **Architecture Diagram** showing key components and their interactions.
    - Rest is up to you. You can have additional slides if you are more comfortable, or otherwise just use whiteboard to be able to go into questions in more detail
- No code is expected, the focus is on the high-level components that make up the solution. However, if you want to present something that showcases your focus on high-quality code, your are welcome to provide that.
- It's not an exam, but trying to provide a playground for having a discussion around a complex problem. You can make assumptions and use them to justify your solution if they are reasonable.

## 📅 Timeline & Submission Instructions

You have 48 hours to complete and submit the 5-minute high-level presentation via email. A clear deadline will be sent to you via Upwork. Time management is key, so plan your steps carefully.

- Submissions after the deadline will not be considered

Submit your assignment deliverables via email to paola@socialtoast.ai and cc liz@socialtoast.ai.

- Please attach to your email ALL the info you’ve submitted in your original proposal on Upwork (loom videos, answers to questions, cover letter, upwork profile, etc)
